Slidden is an open source, customizable, iOS 8 keyboard, written in Swift.
iOS 8 brought us the ability to create fully customizable keyboards, but does not provide a strong foundation to start from. 
Slidden aims to remedy that by providing an easy way to get started making your own iOS keyboards. 

> Slidden is named after the [Sholes and Glidden typewriter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sholes_and_Glidden_typewriter), the first commercially successful typewriter and the origin of the QWERTY keyboard.

## Features

### Planned for 1.0 Release
- Multiple states (Shift, numbers/symbols, etc.)
- Full default English keyboard
- Delegate

### Notice
Slidden is in its early stages of life. Code will change dramatically between updates. 
Please consider contributing your ideas if you think something is missing!

## Requirements
- Xcode 10
- Swift 5.0
- iOS 8.0+

## Installation
At the current moment, the best installation method is to add Slidden as a git submodule and add `Slidden.framework` to your list of Target Dependencies. 
_Don't forget to add `Slidden.framework` to your keyboard's list of target dependencies as well!_

## Usage

### Simple

If you subclass Slidden.KeyboardViewController, you get a `KeyboardView` and nice autolayout constraints right out of the box. Subclassing is as easy as:

```swift
class KeyboardViewController: Slidden.KeyboardViewController {
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()

        // Add the keys we need to the keyboard
        setupKeys()
    }
```

Add keys to the keyboard.
```swift
func setupKeys() {
        let helloKey = KeyboardKeyView(type: .Character, keyCap: "Hello", outputText: "Hello")
        helloKey.textColor = UIColor.whiteColor()
        helloKey.color = UIColor.blueColor()
        self.keyboardView.addKey(helloKey, row: 0)
        
        let worldKey = KeyboardKeyView(type: .Character, keyCap: "World", outputText: "World")
        worldKey.textColor = UIColor.whiteColor()
        worldKey.color = UIColor.redColor()
        self.keyboardView.addKey(worldKey, row: 0)
}
```

Add images to your keys. 
```
func setupKeys() {
	let shiftKey = KeyboardKeyView(type: .Shift, keyCap:"", outputText: "")
    let img = UIImage(named:"Shift")
    shiftKey.image = img
    shiftKey.imageView.contentMode = .Center
}
```

If you want your image to be the same color as your other keys' text, you can use `shouldColorImage` to have CoreGraphics redraw the image of your key with the uniform color. 
```
func setupKeys() {
	let shiftKey = KeyboardKeyView(type: .Shift, keyCap:"", outputText: "")
    let img = UIImage(named:"Shift")
    
    shiftKey.image = img
    shiftKey.imageView.contentMode = .Center
    
    shiftKey.color = UIColor.blueColor()
    shiftKey.selectedColor = UIColor.darkerBlueColor()
    shiftKey.textColor = UIColor.whiteColor()
    shiftKey.shouldColorImage = true // Will redraw the Shift image to match `textColor`
}
```
